# coding_portfolio
This repository contains a sample of my code written for both courses and research projects.  If you are looking for the original repositories for these pieces of code, please see the enclosed links.

## E 115
This folder contains a sample of code written for Stevens Institute of Technology's E 115 class: Intro to Programming.  It includes a few of my homework assignments, including a calculator program, a grade average claculator, and a "vending machine".  It also contains my final project - a game that I recommend playing before reading the code.  These pieces were all written inc C++ and compiled on Microsoft Visual Studios 2015.  This code is not contained in any other online repository at this time.

## motion_hokuyo
This folder is Part 2 to the spin_hokuyo folder, both of which were developed during Summer 2017 as part of Stevens Institute of Technology's Pinnacle Scholars Research program.  This code was written to be used with the Robot Operating System (ROS) Indigo and is primarily in C++.  It is going to be used to detect motion in laser sensors and still under development.  The folder contains the most up-to-date versions as of July XX, 2017.</br>
The active repository for this code can be found at: https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/motion_hokuyo

## spin_hokuyo
This folder is Part 1 of my summer research with Stevens Institute of Technology's Robust Field Autonomy Lab (RFAL).  A full explination and documentation for this code can be found in the folder itself.  This code is primarily C++ written for ROS Indigo and is used on the RFAL's Jackal robot.  It allows for a 2D Hokuyo laser to be coupled with a Dynamixel servo motor to create 3D point clouds that can be visualized in rviz and used in an octomap.  spin_hokuyo is currently in the process of becoming a ROS package.  This code and motion_hokuyo were developed in conjunction with my lab partner, Paul Szenher. </br>
